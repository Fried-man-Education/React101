# React101 - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. React Router & Redux) - Student Solutions

Welcome to my GitHub repository of solutions for the "React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. React Router & Redux)" course. This repository contains my personal solutions to the assignments, challenges, and projects presented throughout the course. Dive into each folder to explore React components, applications, and more that I've built to solidify my understanding of React and its ecosystem.

## About The Course

"React - The Complete Guide 2024" is a comprehensive course designed to take you from a beginner to an advanced level in React development. The course covers everything from basic React concepts to advanced topics like Redux, React Router, and Next.js. By the end of this course, you'll have built multiple high-quality demo apps and gained the knowledge to tackle real-world React projects.

## Course Content Overview

- **Introduction to React.js**: Understanding the core concepts and advantages of using React.
- **React Basics**: Components, JSX, props, and state management.
- **Advanced React**: Hooks, Context API, and managing side effects.
- **Routing**: Using React Router for navigating within our applications.
- **State Management**: An in-depth look at Redux and React's Context API for global state management.
- **Next.js**: Building fullstack React applications and static sites.
- **Additional Topics**: Unit testing, TypeScript integration, animations, and more.

## Repository Structure
- **Code Snapshots:** All code snapshots (starting snapshots, intermediate snapshots, finished snapshots) for the various course sections can be found in the [/code](/code/) folder.
- **Lecture Attachments:** Any standalone code files or other attachments that are mentioned in course lectures (and attached to those lectures) are stored in the [/attachments](/attachments/) folder.
- **Other Resources:** Other resources (like the course slides) can be found in the [/other](/other/) folder.

The **Code Snapshots** and **Lecture Attachments** folders contain one subfolder per course section - this allows you to easily access the resources for a specific course section.

### How To Use Code Snapshots

Code snapshots are primarily provided to allow you to compare your code to mine. The snapshots are taken directly from the course recordings and therefore reflect my code you see in the videos.

Of course, you can also try running those code snapshots on your machine. You'll need to run `npm install` in the individual snapshot folders, followed by `npm run dev` to start the development server - just as shown in the course.

Additionally, installation can be done through running `sudo npm install react-scripts --save` and launch with `sudo npm start`

## How to Use This Repository

- **Explore**: Browse through the folders to see solutions and project examples.
- **Clone**: Feel free to clone this repo if you'd like to run these projects locally.
- **Feedback**: Any feedback or contributions to improve the solutions are welcome.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of these solutions, you should have a basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Familiarity with ES6+ features is beneficial but not mandatory.
